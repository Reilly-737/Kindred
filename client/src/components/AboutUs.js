            <h2>about the admin</h2>

            <p>
              I'm Reilly, the creator of Kindred! As an artist myself,
              specializing in expressionist, childlike forms, my pieces delve
              into the odd realms of body dysmorphia, disconnection, death,
              existentialism, and spirituality. Through my art, I aim to explore
              what this existence means to me and what does it mean to be alive?
            </p>
            <p>
              Kindred is more than just a platform; it's a departure from
              conventional norms, a celebration of the diverse expressions that
              make every individual an artist. Here, we believe that living and
              being are acts of performance art, and everyone has a canvas to
              contribute to the masterpiece of existence. Join us at Kindred,
              where every brushstroke, sculpture, or performance is a step
              towards fostering a community that appreciates artistic
              expression.
