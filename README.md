# Kindred

## Where Artists Connect and Create

Welcome to Kindred, an artist-friendly platform created as a safe space for users to share their artwork and engage in discussions on various art-related topics. With a deliberate avoidance of likes or popularity metrics, Kindred alleviates the apprehension artists often feel when sharing their work, welcoming art in any medium and aiming to create a diverse and inclusive community.

## **Under the Hood**

  Kindred combines a powerful backend built with Flask and SQLAlchemy with a responsive front-end designed using React. 
  The application leverages advanced features such as React Context for state management, React Router for navigation, Formik and Yup for form handling, 
  Bcrypt for secure password handling, and .env for environment configuration. Additional functionalities include Snackbars for notifications, useOutletContext 
  for component communication, CORS for resource sharing, and Session for maintaining user state.

## **New Feature: Cloudinary Integration**

We've integrated Cloudinary API in our Upload feature, allowing users' artwork to be saved securely and efficiently in the cloud.
